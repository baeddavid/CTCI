Sort Stack

Write a program to sort a stack such that the smallest items are on the top. You can use an additional temprorary stack, but you may not copy the
elements into any other data structure. The stack supports the following operations, push, pop, peek, and isEmpty.

We create an additional stack T that is the same size as the input stack S. The goal is to perform a very rough sort algorithm using swaps. A good
comparision would be insertion sort as we will be shifting back larger variables to the bottom of the stack one shift at a time.

SortStack(S)
    T <-- New Stack
    while !S.isEmpty() do
          element <-- S.pop()
          while !T.isEmpty() AND element > T.peek() do
                S.push(T.pop())
          T.push(element)
