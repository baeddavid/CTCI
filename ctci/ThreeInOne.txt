Three in One
Describe how you could use a single array to implement three stacks

Solution

-- N/3
We could partition the array into three stacks and label them as such.
S1 would consist of [0...N/3]
S2 would consist of [N/3...2N/3]
S3 would consist of [2N/3...N]

All methods such as peek, pop, push, etc would take an additional parameter that indicates which stack to perform the operation on. If an operation were
to exceed the constraints of the stack then we would throw an error or an exception.
