Rotate Array
Given an unsorted array A of size N, rotate it by D elements (clockwise).
A: <1,2,3,4,5> D: 2
O: <4,5,1,2,3>

Solution

Brute Force Solution
- A somewhat obvious solution would be to shift the array down once, D times. The time complexity for such a solution would be O(dn).

RotateArray(A, D)
    while D > 0 do
          D -= 1
          temp <-- A[1]
          for i <-- 1 to A.length - 1 do
              A[i + 1] <-- A[i]
          A[A.length] = temp
