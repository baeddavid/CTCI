// Imagine a literal stack of plates. If the stack gets too high, it might topple. Therefore, in real life, we sould likely start a new stack when the
// previous stack exceeds some threshold. Implement a data structure SetOfStacks that mimics this. SetOfStacks should be composed of several stacks and
// should create a new stack once the previous one exceeds capacity.
