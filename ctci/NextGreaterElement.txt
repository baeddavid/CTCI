Next Greater Element

Given an array, print the Next Greater Element (NGE) for every element. The Next greater Element for an element x is the firster greater element on the
right side of x in array. Elements for which no greater element exists, consider next greater element as -1.

Solution

Brute force solution
- The brute force solution is fairly straight forward. We have two for loops one nested in the other.
  If the element at A[j] is greater than the element at A[i] then we break, print out A[i] --> A[j] and continue to the next iteration.

NGE(A)
    for i <-- 1 to A.length do
        next <-- -1
        for j <-- i + 1 to A.length do
            if A[i] < A[j] do
                next <-- A[j]
                break
        print(A[i] --> next)

Stack Solution
- A better solution we can do to reduce the time complexity of the answer is to use a stack and keep track of the next element and see if it is larger
  than the current element we are on. If it is larger we print out S.pop() --> next. If the element is not larger, we push the element back onto the
  stack. It is important to note that we always add the next element to the stack.

NGE(A)
    S <-- new Stack
    S.push(A[1])

    for i <-- 2 to A.length do
        next <-- A[i]
        if S.isEmpty() = false do
           element <-- S.pop()
           while element < next do
               print(element --> next)
               if s.isEmpty() = false do
                  break
               element <-- s.pop()
           if element > next do
              s.push(element)
        s.push(next)
    while s.isEmpty() = false do
        element <-- s.pop()
        next <-- -1
        print(element --> next)
