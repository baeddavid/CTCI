Leaders in an Array

Write a program to print all the leaders in the array. An element is a leader if it is greater than all the elements to its right side.
The rightmost element is always a leader. For example in the array <16,17,4,3,5,2> leaders are 17, 5, and 2.

Solution

Optimal Solution
- We start from the right side of the array and keep track of a "rolling" maximum. If an elment at any index is greater than the maximum value
  found so far print it and update the maximum.

ArrayLeaders(A)
    maximum <-- A[A.length]
    print(maximum)

    for i <-- A.length - 1 to 1 do
        if A[i] > maximum
           maximum = A[i]
           print(maximum)
